											Welcome to our thriving car sharing community. We are
											dedicated to ensuring a safe, respectful, and enjoyable
											environment for all our members. Please carefully review
											and adhere to the following comprehensive guidelines to
											promote a positive and responsible community:
										</p>
										<br />
										<h2>1. Respect for All Members:</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Respect and kindness are the cornerstones of our
												community. Treat all members, whether drivers or
												passengers, with politeness and empathy.
											</li>
											<li>
												Do not engage in offensive, abusive, discriminatory, or
												harmful behavior or language, either in your
												interactions or through communication on our platform.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br />
										<h2>2. Prioritize Safety:</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Safety is our top priority. Always obey local traffic
												laws, regulations, and safety recommendations.
											</li>
											<li>
												As a driver, ensure your car is in excellent working
												condition and regularly serviced. Passengers should also
												consider the safety of the ride.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br />
										<h2>3. Effective Communication:</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Maintain open and transparent communication with other
												community members. This includes sharing clear trip
												details, discussing pickup and drop-off locations, and
												addressing any changes in plans.
											</li>
											<li>
												Respond to messages and inquiries from other users in a
												timely and respectful manner.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br />
										<h2>4. Honesty and Transparency:</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Be forthright and transparent in your dealings. Provide
												accurate information about your car's condition,
												mileage, and other relevant details to prevent
												misunderstandings.
											</li>
											<li>
												Disclose any known issues, limitations, or special
												conditions of your car before sharing it with others.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br />
										<h2>5. Punctuality:</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Be punctual for your scheduled trips, whether you are
												the driver or passenger. Respect the agreed-upon pickup
												and drop-off times to ensure a smooth experience for
												everyone.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br />
										<h2>6. Cleanliness and Maintenance:</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Maintain the shared car in a clean and organized state.
												Leave the vehicle as clean as or cleaner than you found
												it.
											</li>
											<li>
												Report any mess, damage, or maintenance issues
												immediately. If you are responsible for any damage,
												discuss the matter with the owner.

												security issues, promptly report these matters to the
												platform administrators.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br />
										<h2>8. Ratings and Reviews:</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												After each trip, provide constructive and honest
												feedback through ratings and reviews. This feedback
												system promotes accountability and trust within the
												community.
											</li>
											<li>
												Refrain from leaving false, misleading, or inappropriate
												feedback. Remember, constructive criticism can help
												fellow members improve.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br />
										<h2>9. Non-Commercial Use:</h2>
										<ul>
